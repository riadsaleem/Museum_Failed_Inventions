                    <h3>Ford Edsel (1957-1960)</h3>
                    <p>The car that became synonymous with commercial failure. Despite massive marketing efforts and a $250 million investment, the Edsel's unusual design and high price tag during a recession made it one of automotive history's biggest flops.</p>

                    <h3>Google Glass (2012-2015)</h3>
                    <p>The future of wearable technology that arrived too early. Privacy concerns, social stigma, and technical limitations turned this revolutionary idea into a cautionary tale about timing in tech innovation.</p>

                    <h3>New Coke (1985)</h3>
                    <p>What do you do when you sell the world's most popular soft drink? Change the formula, of course! Coca-Cola's attempt to compete with Pepsi backfired spectacularly, lasting only 79 days before returning to the classic formula.</p>

                    <h3>Urban Window Baby Cage (1930s)</h3>
                    <p>Dubbed by Time as one of the "50 worst inventions," this contraption was used to give city babies fresh air by dangling them outside apartment windows. The obvious safety risks made this a short-lived trend.</p>
