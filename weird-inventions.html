                    <p>Going bald? Just spray paint your head! This "revolutionary" product promises to fill sparse spots on your dome. Is it basically like spray painting your head? Yes. Would it be more dignified to embrace baldness? Absolutely, but who needs dignity when you have aerosol on your side?</p>

                    <p>Finally! A pen "designed to fit comfortably in a woman's hand." Because apparently, regular pens were too masculine for female scribblers. The absurdity was met with hilarious online reviews, including: "I keep urinating on it and it won't turn pink OR blue!"</p>

                    <h3>Harley-Davidson Perfume</h3>
                    <p>Nothing says "tough biker" like smelling like flowers! In 1996, Harley released perfumes called "Black Fire," "Destiny," and "Hot Rod." Bikers everywhere turned up their noses at this misguided attempt to sniff up some profits. The eau de toilette went right in the toilet.</p>

                    <p>When people say your beer tastes like water, what do you do? Sell actual water, of course! Coors decided to turn criticism into opportunity by selling "water minus the beer" in 1990. Spoiler alert: it fizzled faster than flat soda.</p>
